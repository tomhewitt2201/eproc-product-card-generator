# eproc-product-card-generator
Quick Vanilla JS program to populate products within the basket of my company's website.

Uses an array of objects to populate a list of products to be shown at the beginning of the checkout process. 

For a working example, visit: https://www.manutan.co.uk/AjaxOrderItemDisplayView (having added a product to the basket).
